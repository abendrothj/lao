# LAO UI Enhancements

## Overview
This implementation enhances the LAO UI with comprehensive workflow execution, visual editing, and live monitoring capabilities.

## Key Features

### 1. Complete Workflow Execution from UI
- Real-time progress tracking with visual indicators
- Execution status monitoring (pending → running → success/error)
- Comprehensive execution summary with timing and statistics
- Error handling with detailed feedback

### 2. Advanced Node/Edge Editing
- Drag-and-drop node positioning with grid snapping
- Visual edge creation through connection mode
- Color-coded node states for status visualization
- Save/export workflows to YAML files
- Node inspector for property editing

### 3. Live Status & Logs
- Color-coded logs with real-time updates
- Auto-scrolling log display with clear functionality
- Visual execution progress in the workflow graph
- Status indicators for current workflow state

## Technical Enhancements

### Backend (`backend.rs`)
- Enhanced `GraphNode` with execution state tracking
- New `WorkflowResult` structure for execution summaries  
- Improved `run_workflow_stream` function with real-time callbacks
- Workflow save/export functionality

### UI (`ui.rs`)
- Enhanced visual editor with connection capabilities
- Improved log display with color coding and filtering
- Modal dialogs for save/export operations
- Better user feedback and status indicators

## Usage

### Creating Workflows
1. Click "New Workflow" to start
2. Add nodes using the "Add Node" controls
3. Select plugin types from the dropdown
4. Use "Connect From" to link nodes together
5. Save or export the workflow when complete

### Executing Workflows
1. Load a workflow YAML file
2. Click "Run" or "Run (Parallel)" 
3. Monitor progress in real-time
4. View logs and execution results

### Monitoring
- Watch node colors change during execution
- Follow progress in the live logs section
- View execution summary upon completion

This implementation provides a complete no-code workflow authoring and execution environment with professional-grade observability and debugging capabilities.
